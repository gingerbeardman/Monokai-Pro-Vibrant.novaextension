_This is an unofficial Monokai Pro theme by Tony Keiser. Credit goes to Monokai Pro (https://monokai.pro) and its original creator. This plugin includes the default theme and the original four filters: Machine, Octagon, Ristretto, and Spectrum. Also includes two new filters: Light and Warm._

## About this fork

This **Vibrant** fork has been modified by gingerbeardman to use vibrant window style so that there are more obvious differences between focused and unfocused windows. Some other small usability changes were made to Spectrum and Pro variations so that selected text is visible in all situations.
